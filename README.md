## Installation

1- Check if the folder where your modules are located is defined in the path:
```
> python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"
```

2- If not defined, add the path to the folder to PYTHONPATH (following command will append the path. Just change the root path to your own path):
```
> export PYTHONPATH="/Users/xpadro/python-algorithms/app"
```
